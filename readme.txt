Age Comparison Program:
This C++ program compares the user's input age with a fixed value (20 years) and prints a message based on the comparison.

Program Overview:
- Prompts the user to input their age in years
- Compares the user's age to the programmer's age (20 years)
- Outputs one of the following messages:
    - User is younger than the programmer
    - User is the same age as the programmer
    - User is older than the programmer

Features:
- User input for age
- Conditional statements for age comparison
- Clear and informative output

How to Run the Program:
1. Copy the provided C++ code into a .cpp file
2. Compile the program using a C++ compiler
3. Run the compiled program:
    - On Linux/macOS: ./age_comparison
    - On Windows: age_comparison.exe
4. Enter your age when prompted

Learning Objectives:
- Understanding basic user input and output
- Using conditional statements (if, else if, else) in C++
- Working with integer variables
